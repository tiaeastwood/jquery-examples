## jQuery Examples

This is practice / reference project.

Honestly, I never use jQuery because I do almost everything using a framework such as React. However, you may find jQuery useful if you're building a pure html website. jQuery is a JavaScript library that can help to reduce the amount of coed you need to write, as well as making it a little more readable.

There is also a basic example of CSS grid in this project.
